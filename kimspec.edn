    "description" "This \"supermodel\" allows the use of PCFF bonded force-fields for covalent bonds, and the IFF non-bonded 9-6 Lennard-Jones potentials for interactions with between ceramic inorganics and several face-centered cubic metals (Ag, Al, Au, Cu, Ni, Pb, Pd, Pt).  the model reproduces densities, surface tensions, interface properties with water and (bio)organic molecules, as well as mechanical properties in quantitative (<0.1%) to good qualitative (25%) agreement with experiment under ambient conditions. Deviations associated with earlier LJ models have been reduced by 1 order of magnitude due to the precise fit of the new models to densities and surface tensions under standard conditions, which also leads to significantly improved results for surface energy anisotropies, interface tensions, and mechanical properties. The performance is comparable to tight-binding and embedded atom models at up to a million times lower computational cost. The models extend classical simulation methods to metals and a variety of nanostructured materials through the PCFF. Limitations include the neglect of electronic structure effects and the restriction to noncovalent interactions with the metals."
